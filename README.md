# browser-spellfix

I make mistakes when I write things in my browser all the time, I type too fast and I cannot be bothered to go back through and right-click each red squiggle and correct my mistakes, particularly when some spell checkers in browsers take a while because of all the other shit that the page is trying to render.

Enter, browser-spellfix, so I can hit a hotkey and whatever garbage I just wrote can be piped into Azure OpenAI and replaced with what I said, but spelled correctly. 

I do not care about what I am writing, I just want it to be spelled right, it doesn't even have to be grammatically correct, so long as it's not obvious that I suck at using a keyboard and just straightup do not care about mashing 7 keys at once despite aiming for the space bar.
